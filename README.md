# covics-19

test push

SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly through communities, and healthcare systems are struggling to keep up. Hospitals are struggling to cope with the influx of patients and are reaching a point of saturation. We propose a scheme that allows regions to predict how many COVID-19 patients they will have to provide in-patient medical care for in the next 3 weeks. Regions that will not have enough resources to cope with their COVID-19 patients in any given week will be matched to a region that will have a surplus of medical resources that week, so that the burden can be shared and more patients can receive life-saving treatment. As the infection moves globally, countries that bring their cases under control will be able to provide aid to countries where cases are rising rapidly.
